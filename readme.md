# 8 Ball - CS 3200 Assignment #1
Create a simple client web application that demonstrates certain requirements.

<br>

## Requirements
- [ ] DOM querying: query elements from the DOM as necessary to build a functioning application.
- [ ] DOM manipulation: modify DOM elements as necessary to evolve both the content and style of page elements.
- [ ] DOM insertion: create new DOM elements and insert them into the DOM to generate new page content.
- [ ] Events: use events, such as onclick, to make the application functional and interactive.
- [ ] Randomness: integrate an element of randomness into the application, because randomness is funness.
- [ ] Data: integrate some representation of data into the application, using JavaScript arrays and objects to store it.
- [ ] Ajax: use the XMLHttpRequest object to receive data from a server and represent it within the application.
