# 8 Ball - CS 3200 Assignment #1
Create a simple client web application that demonstrates certain requirements.

## Requirements
- [x] **DOM querying**: query elements from the DOM as necessary to build a functioning application.
- [x] **DOM manipulation**: modify DOM elements as necessary to evolve both the content and style of page elements.
- [x] **DOM insertion**: create new DOM elements and insert them into the DOM to generate new page content.
- [x] **Events**: use events, such as onclick, to make the application functional and interactive.
- [x] **Randomness**: integrate an element of randomness into the application, because randomness is funness.
- [x] **Data**: integrate some representation of data into the application, using JavaScript arrays and objects to store it.
- [x] **Ajax**: use the XMLHttpRequest object to receive data from a server and represent it within the application.
